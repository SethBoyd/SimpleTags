# Simple Tags
A very simple solution to providing tagging that is reportable in Salesforce. Since the switch to Lightning the easy ability to take a record without using Topics in chatter and then report on them has been limited. This simple application fills that gap. We see this requirement come up a lot in the Nonprofit world the need to tag a grant based on theme, category, location and potentially funder. This can be acheived with dependent multi-select picklists but as we all know reporting on them is a pain.
